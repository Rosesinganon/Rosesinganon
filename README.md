ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Rosesinganon
  Hello, Iâ€™m Rose, a certified English teacher from Australia with over 7 years of experience teaching students worldwide. I have taught on platforms like DADAABC and Preply, specializing in IELTS preparation and business conversational skills. I hold a bachelor's degree in education, a TEFL certificate, and an IELTS trainer certification.

Whether you're a beginner or advanced learner, I'll help you improve your language skills. In my group classes, I ensure everyone feels comfortable and involved. For beginners, I focus on basic vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation through interactive activities. Advanced students work on fluency and expanding vocabulary.

Let's create a positive atmosphere and achieve your language goals together!
